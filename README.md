# Second-Hand Selling App - DoneWithIt

This is a mobile app built with Expo, React Native, and Material UI that allows users to buy and sell second-hand items. Building this as I learn and get my hands dirty with React Native as a dev with mainly a React background :) 

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you'll need to have Expo installed on your computer. If you haven't installed Expo yet, you can follow the instructions on the Expo website: https://expo.io/learn.

Once you have Expo installed, you can clone this repository and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

You can then start the app with the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will open the Expo DevTools in your browser. You can then choose to run the app on an iOS or Android simulator, or on your own device using the Expo app.
